# Landing-Page
Page created with basic HTML and CSS (with flexbox) after 4 days (with no
prior knowledge) of following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). The page only features style. 

The page was implemented referencing [this picture](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

Both the HTML and the CSS could use some refactoring for simplicity. Also, in hindsight the CSS file follows no naming convention and is hugely inconsistent in that regard. This is easily fixed, but also time consuming.
